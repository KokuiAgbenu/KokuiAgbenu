<b><br><i>About Me</i><br></b>
I’m transitioning into cybersecurity with a focus on governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). With a background in tech customer support and administration, I’m skilled at breaking down complex processes and making them easy to follow.

On this GitHub, I share hands-on projects, from risk registers to access control frameworks designed to turn policies into practical, real-world solutions. My goal is to make security as clear and actionable as it is robust.  


<b><i>Current Projects</i></b>
- [<b>Cyber Risk Register</b>](#) – Practical example of identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks.
- [<b>Access Control Framework Guide</b>](#) – Covers RBAC, JML processes, PAM, and access review procedures.
